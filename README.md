# NRS528

## Hi! My name is Nick Curci and I am a first year MESM student on the RSSA Track. I am from Narragansett and started my undergrad at NSU in Fort Lauderdale before finishing at Bryant in Smithfield. I am on the Track and Field team here at URI and I Pole Vault. In my free time I enjoy traveling and surfing.
